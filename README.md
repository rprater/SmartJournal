## ML Natural Language Processing Smart Journal Application

### Description
The Smart Journal application was built to help users clear their head, make important connections between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and even buffer or reduce the effects of mental illness! We set out to accomplish this goal by leveraging [Google Clouds Machine Learning Natural Language Processing Service](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language) to create an intelligent journaling application where users can easily create entries which can be analyzed to understand their thoughts, feelings and behaviors.

We utilize this information to try and understand the pattern behind **what a user is feeling and why they are feeling it?** We then display these patterns on our native IOS and Android mobile application where users can filter and search their journal entries based on date, location, person or feeling. 


#### Our goal is to provide users with the information they need to make positive change in their life.
